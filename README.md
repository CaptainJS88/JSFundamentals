# For Loop Practice Problems

This is a personal repository that contains a set of programming practice problems that focus on using for loops. Whether you're a beginner looking to improve your coding skills or an experienced programmer wanting to sharpen your loop-handling abilities, these problems cover a range of difficulty levels.

## Basic Level

1. **Counting Numbers:** Write a program to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
2. **Sum of Even Numbers:** Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20 using a for loop.
3. **Multiplication Table:** Create a program to print the multiplication table of a given number (e.g., 5) using a for loop.
4. **Factorial:** Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a for loop.
5. **Counting Characters:** Given a string, count and print the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) using a for loop.

## Intermediate Level

6. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Write a program to generate and print the first 20 terms of the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop.
7. **Prime Numbers:** Create a program to find and print all prime numbers in a given range (e.g., 1 to 50) using a for loop.
8. **Reverse a String:** Write a program to reverse a string using a for loop.
9. **Pattern Printing:** Create a program to print a pattern of stars or numbers using nested for loops. For example, print a right-angled triangle of height 5.
10. **Palindrome Check:** Write a program to check if a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same backward) using a for loop.

## Advanced Level

11. **Pascal's Triangle:** Generate and print the first n rows of Pascal's triangle using a for loop.
12. **Matrix Multiplication:** Write a program to multiply two matrices using nested for loops.
13. **Sorting Algorithm:** Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort) using a for loop and sort an array of numbers.
14. **Word Frequency Counter:** Given a paragraph of text, count and print the frequency of each word using a for loop.
